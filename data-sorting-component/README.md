## Treehouse Code Adventures: Data Sorting Component

Giving the end-user multiple ways to sort/view their data is a great UX feature. This can be relatively easily by thinking ahead and writing some good CSS. Of course, minimial javascript as well.

Create a component that will allow users to see the exact same data in a minimum of 2 ways. As per the mockups; card view and list view.

Use vanilla javascript or any framework you'd like to tackle this Code Adventure!

#### How to Succeed

1. Create the UI as closely to the mockups as possible.

2. Be sure to set up a "default view" with the corresponding icon having an active state.

3. Upon clicking on a different view, active states should update respectively.

4. Data should sort according to the active icon.

#### Extra Challenges

1. Every item (card, list, etc) should have an animation.
